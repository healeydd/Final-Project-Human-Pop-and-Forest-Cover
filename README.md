## Graphic portrayal of the relationship between deforestation and population and GDP per capita
This repository contains the necessary materials for "_Temporal Variability in Deforestation and the Implications for Human Populations_" submitted for the course Environmental Data Exploration and Analysis in 2021. Code included computes averages and rates of change for percent of land covered by forest, population, and GDP per capita for U.S., Brazil, and Liberia. In addition, it creates figures and statistical correlation of the three datasets. The code is run in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
## Data Availability Statement
Percent of land covered by forest is available at [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/forest-area-as-share-of-land-area?tab=chart). Population data is available from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL). GDP per capita is also available from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD).
## Analysis
We did not use any outside functions in our analysis of the data.
